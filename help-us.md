# How to Contribute

Thank you for reading this out. We are really grateful to you that you have thought of helping out. Yes people need help. We have decided to help people \(Aspiring UX Designers\)  by  design  courses with the help of publicly available contents and media.  

We found that people across the world are looking for courses to gain knowledge but not all are in a situation to afford high cost of education. So we asked ourselves _**How might we develop courses that are Useful, Free and people do not have to break their banks even before they start their career?**_ 

If you want to be one of us to develop many more courses will all of us as a _**Volunteer, Course curator, Copy Writer, Workshop facilitator, Product Manager, Project Manager, Design Sprint Organiser, Design Thinker , you are welcome  to join the party.**_  Please write to us  _**thegoutamdey@gmail.com**_ or DM us at _**@thegoutamdey**_ . 

We are looking for UX interns and volunteers to sail through the UX journey to develop many more courses as a product and make those products live for our fellow members absolutely FREE.
