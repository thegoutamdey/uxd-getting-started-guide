# What is UX?

User experience or UX was a term that simply applied to how a person feels about using a system.

The term ‘user experience design’ was first coined by [Don Norman](https://www.jnd.org/) in 1995 while he was the vice president of the Advanced Technology Group at Apple. He said:

> “I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow. I wanted to cover all aspects of the person’s experience with the system including industrial design, graphics, the interface, the physical interaction, and the manual.”

Norman also authored the book ‘The Design of Everyday Things’ which pioneered the prioritization of usability and function over aesthetics and remains highly influential in design circles today.

At the core of UX is ensuring that users find value in what you are providing to them.  Peter Morville represents this through his User Experience Honeycomb.

He notes that in order for there to be a meaningful and valuable user experience, information must be:

* **Useful**: Your content should be original and fulfill a need
* **Usable**: Site must be easy to use
* **Desirable**: Image, identity, brand, and other design elements are used to evoke emotion and appreciation
* **Findable**: Content needs to be navigable and locatable onsite and offsite
* **Accessible**: Content needs to be accessible to people with disabilities
* **Credible**: Users must trust and believe what you tell them
