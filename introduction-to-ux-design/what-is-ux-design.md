# What is UX?

User experience or UX was a term that simply applied to how a person feels about using a system.

The term ‘user experience design’ was first coined by [Don Norman](https://www.jnd.org/) in 1995 while he was the vice president of the Advanced Technology Group at Apple. He said:

> “I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow. I wanted to cover all aspects of the person’s experience with the system including industrial design, graphics, the interface, the physical interaction, and the manual.”

Norman also authored the book ‘The Design of Everyday Things’ which pioneered the prioritization of usability and function over aesthetics and remains highly influential in design circles today.
