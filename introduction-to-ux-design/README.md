At the core of UX is ensuring that users find value in what you are providing to them.  Peter Morville represents this through his User Experience Honeycomb.

He notes that in order for there to be a meaningful and valuable user experience, information must be:

* **Useful**: Your content should be original and fulfill a need
* **Usable**: Site must be easy to use
* **Desirable**: Image, identity, brand, and other design elements are used to evoke emotion and appreciation
* **Findable**: Content needs to be navigable and locatable onsite and offsite
* **Accessible**: Content needs to be accessible to people with disabilities
* **Credible**: Users must trust and believe what you tell them
